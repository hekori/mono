## Create Feedback

As Facility Manager, I log into the website and click on the
"+ New Feedback" button.

I enter 
- "Waiting Times"
- "Personnel"
- "Opening Hours"

then click the "Save" button.
I see a screen where I can see the current status
of the feedbacks. No Feedback has been given yet.
I click the button "Print PDF". My browser opens
the PDF. I print the PDF and put it on the door
so visitors see it when they leave the facility.



## Give Feedback

As a Visitors, I see the following printout at the door of
my grocery store.

Everything in order?

I scan the Opening Hours QR code with my mobile phone.
My mobile phone opens the browser and shows me Emoji reactions
and a free text field.

I select the Smiley emoji and add a short note that I am super happy
that the shop opens at 07:00h in the morning.


I click "Send feedback" and see a success message
